# Super-Monotonic-Alignment-Search

This repo contains [Triton-Lang](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton) and PyTorch implementation of the monotonic alignment search (MAS), originally from [Glow-TTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11129).
MAS is an effective algorithm for estimating the alignment between paired speech and text in a self-supervised manner.


The authors of Glow-TTS noted:
> "The time complexity of the algorithm is O(T_{text} Ã— T_{mel}). Even though the algorithm is difficult to parallelize, it runs efficiently on CPU without the need for GPU executions. In our experiments, it spends less than 20 ms on each iteration, which amounts to less than 2% of the total training time. Furthermore, we do not need MAS during inference, as the duration predictor is used to estimate the alignment."

However, we found two things.
1. MAS can be parallelized in the text-length dimension.
2. CPU execution consumes an inordinate amount of time for large inputs due to the need to copy large tensors between CPU and GPU.

Therefore, we implemented a Triton kernel to accelerate MAS without inter-device copy.

# Requirments
1. PyTorch (tested with version `torch==2.3.0+cu121`)
2. Triton-Lang (tested with version `triton==2.3.0`)

Please ensure you have these packages installed to run the code in this repository, as version checks are not enforced.

# How to use
1. Install super-monotonic-align
```
cd super_monotonic_align; pip install -e ./
```
or
```
pip install git+https://github.com/supertone-inc/super-monotonic-align.git
```
2. Import `super_monotonic_align` and use it!
```python
from super_monotonic_align import maximum_path
...
value = torch.randn((B, T, S), dtype=torch.float32, device='cuda')
attn_mask = torch.ones((B, T, S), dtype=torch.int32, device='cuda')
# path: [B,T,S], you can specify dtype of path
path = maximum_path(value, attn_mask, dtype=dtype)
```
